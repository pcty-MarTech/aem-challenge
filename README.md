# AEM Coding Challenge: Cat Fact Component

## Objective
Enhance the existing "Cat Fact" Component to fetch and display random cat facts using the [Cat Facts API](https://publicapis.io/cat-facts-api).

## Task Description
1. **Fetch Data**  
   Use the [Cat Facts API](https://publicapis.io/cat-facts-api) to retrieve a random cat fact.

2. **Update Component**  
   Modify the existing "Cat Fact" Component to:
    - Display the random cat fact.
    - Display the date the fact was created below the fact.

3. **Integration**
    - Ensure the component integrates seamlessly with the current AEM setup.
    - Use client-side or server-side implementation as appropriate.

## Deliverables
- The updated code for the "Cat Fact" Component.
- Instructions to build and deploy the component.
- A brief explanation of your approach and choices in a `README.md`.

## Requirements
- Use best practices for AEM component development.
- Ensure the component is reusable and follows AEM conventions.
- The component should handle errors gracefully (e.g., API unavailability).
- Add styling to make the component visually appealing.
  - Example: ![img.png](img.png)

## Bonus Points
- Implement a fallback message if the API request fails.
- Add style system to change the appearance.
- Write a unit test for the functionality.

## Submission
- Submit the modified code as a `.zip` file or a link to a version control repository.
